This repository showcases my exploration of recursive functions in C++ to solve common problems in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I implemented recursive solutions for factorial calculation, the Ackermann function, the binomial coefficient, and primality testing.

Introduction
In this repository, I focus on solving problems with recursive algorithms, helping me develop a deeper understanding of recursion in C++.

Implemented Functions
Here are the functions I implemented recursively:

Factorial: Computes the factorial of a number.
Ackermann Function: An example of a highly recursive mathematical function.
Binomial Coefficient: Calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose k).
Prime Check: Determines whether a number is prime.
Challenges
Base Case Identification: Ensuring the recursion halts at the correct point.
Stack Overflow: Managing recursion depth to avoid overflow.
Debugging: Understanding recursive calls can be tricky.
Learnings
Recursion helps break down complex problems.
Optimization techniques like memoization or dynamic programming can improve recursive solutions.
Understanding recursion deeply enhances problem-solving skills in algorithms.
