This repository contains code examples and explanations from the first lecture of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab, where we reviewed important Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The main topics covered in this lecture include Classes, Templates, File I/O, and Type Aliases.

Topics Covered
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Classes: Introduction to defining classes and creating objects. We also discussed encapsulation (keeping data safe inside classes) and how classes interact with member functions.
Inheritance: The concept of one class inheriting properties and behaviors from another class, allowing for code reuse and better organization.
Polymorphism: A feature that allows functions or methods to operate differently based on the object type.
File I/O (Input/Output)

File Handling: Understanding how to read data from files and write data to files in C++.
Stream Classes: We worked with the ifstream (input file stream) and ofstream (output file stream) classes to perform file operations.
Error Handling: We discussed how to check if files open correctly and how to handle errors during file operations.
Class Templates

Generic Classes: We explored how to define classes that can work with any data type by using templates, making our code more flexible and reusable.
Function Templates

Generic Functions: We learned how to define functions that can work with any data type, making our code cleaner and reusable for different types.
Type Aliases

Using typedef and using: We learned how to create type aliases to improve code readability, making long data type names easier to use and understand.
