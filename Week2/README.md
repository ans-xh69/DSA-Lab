This repository contains code examples and explanations from the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab, where we implemented basic stack operations to understand stack data structures better. The main topics covered in this lab exercise include stack operations and their application.

Topics Covered
Stack Operations
push(): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
reverseString(): Reverses a given string using stack operations.
Code Structure
stack.h: Contains function prototypes for the stack operations.
stack.cpp: Implements the functions defined in stack.h.
main.cpp: Contains the main function where stack operations are tested.
Key Concepts
Data Structures: The stack is a fundamental data structure used to store elements in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
Functions and Header Files: We used header files to declare function prototypes and .cpp files to define them.
Technologies Used
C++: The language used for implementing stack operations.
